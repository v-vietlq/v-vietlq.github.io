# Introduction

This is the first post of the year 2024!!!

In this first post, I want to reflect on the past year and set new goals for the year ahead. Try new things to achieve different and better results in life. Letâ€™s make 2024 a year of growth and transformation!

# Purpose

The purpose of this blog is to:

- Improve writing skills in both English and Vietnamese.

The topics in this blog are following:

- Recap and take notes on AI and Machine Learning knowledge.
    
    This is a skill that has helped me make money. So, I want to take notes on the knowledge that I have learned and I think it will give me deep understanding of it.
    
- Personal life experiences.
    
    In this topic, I will share my perspective on various problems. I will also provide insights and lessons learned from my personal experiences.
    
- Book perspectives.
    
    In this topic, I will share my thoughts on the books I have read, allowing me to learn new things and review what I have learned.

    This topic will allow me to explore new places and share my experiences.
